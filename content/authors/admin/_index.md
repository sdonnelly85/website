I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. I study individual differences in language acquisition, with a focus on how such differences can constrain theories of language development. I'm also interested in statistical methods for studying individual differences, such as mixed effects models, mixture models, and item response theory.
